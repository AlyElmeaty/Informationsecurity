A05 highlights the risk of improperly configured security settings in web applications. These misconfigurations can leave systems vulnerable to attacks and data breaches. Examples include default settings, excessive permissions, and unpatched software. Proper configuration and regular audits are essential to mitigate this risk and enhance the security of web applications.  
  
A06 refers to the risk posed by using outdated or insecure third-party components, libraries, or software in web applications. These components may have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Developers should regularly update and patch these components and continuously monitor for security updates. Failure to address this risk can lead to critical security breaches in web applications.    

  
A03 focuses on vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code or commands into an application. Common types include SQL injection, XML injection, and Command injection. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or even full compromise of a system. Preventing injection vulnerabilities involves proper input validation and using prepared statements or parameterized queries to interact with data sources securely. It's a critical security concern to address in web applications.
